Task 2: Generating an Output Image Using Formula
Objective: Combine image algebra operations to generate a final output image.

Task 3: Grayscale to Color Recoloring Using Transfer Functions
You will recolor a grayscale image using transfer functions.
1. Convert the car image to grayscale, luminosity, averaging method, lightness method, Scotopic, photopic methods.
2. Apply the assigned transfer functions (JET, Rainbow, and Thermal) to convert grayscale (only luminosity) values to RGB values.
3. Display the recolored image alongside the original grayscale image.
4. Provide a brief explanation of the transfer function and how it was applied.
